DCS/sql/mssql/fn

This directory contains all functions for the database.

The rules:
  - Names begin with FN9_
	- The name of the file is the name of the function.
	- You are already connected to the database which will get the function.
	- That database does not have a function with the name you will create.
	- The text in the file should be formatted in a readable fashion for easy maintenance.
