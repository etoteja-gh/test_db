Per Chris Harmon, they are not going to pay back or take the following deductions that were created because of this change.          It appears that the customer was not informed of these changes & if we do not straighten this out, they will continue to take deductions where the prices are different from the price sheet that they received since the beginning of time.  I have enclosed a copy of said sheet that was faxed over to me from Chris Harmon.  If possible can you please contact Chris & let him know of the changes?  Perhaps he then will pay?  If not, should I request credit from Customer Service?   Either way, can you please let me know how you want to proceed?
