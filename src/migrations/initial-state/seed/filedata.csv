<p>Dear Accounts Payable,</p>
<p>Your account is considerably past due.  Your past due amount is ${(customer.calc.overDue)!} and your total amount due is ${(customer.calc.totalDue)!}.  We are concerned because we have not heard from you despite our previous invoicing, statements and letters.  We must receive payment immediately in order to keep your account in good standing.  Failure to pay will adversely affect your credit rating and may result in legal action.</p>

<p>Accounts Payable,</p>
<p>We have not received full payment totaling ${(company.calc.totalDue)!}.  This is your total balance including interest and late charges calculated through today's date.  You have received several reminders that your account is considerably overdue, and we are extremely concerned that we have not heard back from you.  Interest charges and late fees will continue to accrue, and your account has been suspended.</p>
<p>The matter is now extremely urgent.  Your invoice will be placed in collection if you have not paid your past due amount within 15 days of your receipt of this message.  Further inaction will jeopardize your credit rating.  Our policy dictates that we send seriously delinquent accounts to our collection agency.  If necessary, we may pursue legal avenues to reconcile this debt.</p>
